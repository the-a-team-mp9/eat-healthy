                                        Children tend to continue eating junk food even after they feel full.
                                        The reward children feel after eating junk foods is a huge motivation for them to demand

                                        Children can educated to choose healthy foods by increased rewards for eating them.
                                        If external incentives apart from the satisfaction of eating healthy foods outweigh the
                                        satisfaction of eating unhealthy foods, children voluntarily choose to eat healthy.

                                        We have designed 3 interesting video games, which teach kids to identify healthy and unhealthy
                                        foods. The games provide rewards for choosing to eat healthy foods and penalise for eating
                                        unhealthy foods. This provides the incentive to slowly reduce the ressistance in children to eating healthy
                                        foods.
